## Description

This bot will give quick and brief updates regarding the IPL 2020. It can display the standings, schedule, live scores, and player stats.

## Deploy your discord bot

First you need to create a **CricApi account** and get the API key. Go to https://www.cricapi.com/ website, register for the free plan. 

>The free plan gives 100 requests per day. But, since the schedule is prefetched, and the standings are scraped from the official IPL website, the number of requests are reduced.

**STEP 1:** Create a Discord Bot Account. This bot doesn't need any extra permissions, just a bot role is enough. For a guide refer to [this](https://realpython.com/how-to-make-a-discord-bot-python/#creating-an-application).

**STEP 2:** Create a Cricapi account, and get the API Key.

> Don't share the API keys and the Discord BOT TOKEN with anyone. Keep them in the .env file.

**STEP 3(Optional):** If you have node installed then you can run the app locally and test it out once, for that just do these

```bash
$ npm i # to install node modules
$ npm run dev # will start the bot and your bot will be online
```

**STEP 4:** Click on the deploy to heroku button. Make sure you configure the API keys in Heroku Settings as well.

## Technologies Used:

1. **Discord.js** : For making  the discord bot
2. **Axios** : For fetching data
3. **Cheerio** : For scraping the IPL standings from the official website

For the other datas I have used the [Cricapi](https://cricapi.com/). They have a really nice collection of cricket related APIs
